Obviously do not plagiarise this code its a class and you take it for a reason, but also this code is not the best. Make yours better.

If you would like to use this code as a reference I would say its best to look at after you have most of yours implemented just to see alternatives etc.

There were four programming assignments and if you're going to look at the code as a comparison after you've done your assignments I think it is nice to know how well this code did:

 1. A* 100/100
 2. Alpha-Beta 96/100 - Feedback: Although your footmen can somehow get past obstacles, they will make some unreasonable moves, such as wandering around. -4
 3. STRIPS Actions 105/100
 4. Q-learning with function approximation 95/100 - Feedback: learning curves should increase. -5
 
As I said it would be very stupid to copy this code however if you are taking this class I wouldn't mind talking to you about it if you want general advice etc. slw96@case.edu
